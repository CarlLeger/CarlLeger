# Carl Leger 👋

🚀 WordPress & WooCommerce performance specialist focused on speed, optimization, and security.  
Founder and developer of **SteaPlay**, a real-world production WooCommerce platform.

---

## 🔧 What I do
- ⚡ WooCommerce speed optimization (Core Web Vitals, TTFB, caching)
- 🧠 Performance troubleshooting (slow wp-admin, heavy plugins, database issues)
- ☁️ Cloudflare & caching rules (WooCommerce-safe)
- 🔒 Security hardening & malware cleanup
- 🧩 Custom WooCommerce features, fixes, and integrations

---

## 🧪 SteaPlay — Real-world case study
**SteaPlay** is my live WooCommerce project used as a production environment to:
- test and validate performance optimizations
- build and deploy custom WooCommerce functionality
- document real fixes, constraints, and scalable setups

This allows me to work on **real production problems**, not just demos or tutorials.
