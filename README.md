Carl Leger 👋

🚀 WordPress & WooCommerce performance specialist focused on speed, optimization, and security.
Founder and developer of SteaPlay, a real-world production WooCommerce platform.

🔧 What I do
⚡ WooCommerce performance optimization (Core Web Vitals, TTFB, caching)
🧠 Performance troubleshooting (slow wp-admin, heavy plugins, database issues)
☁️ Cloudflare & caching rules (WooCommerce-safe)
🔒 Security hardening & malware cleanup
🧩 Custom WooCommerce features, fixes, and integrations
🤝 Collaboration with designers, PMs, and clients in remote environments

🧪 SteaPlay — Real-world case study
SteaPlay is a live WooCommerce project used as a production environment to:
- test and validate performance optimizations
- build and deploy custom WooCommerce functionality
- document real fixes, constraints, and scalable setups

This allows me to work on real production problems, not demos or tutorials.
